### **🚀 What is a Monorepo?**  

A **Monorepo (Monolithic Repository)** is a **single code repository** that contains multiple **projects** or **services**, rather than having separate repositories for each service/module.**  

> Instead of managing multiple repositories for different services (e.g., in a microservices architecture), all code is stored in **one repository**.

## **🔹 Monorepo vs. Polyrepo**
| Feature        | Monorepo  | Polyrepo  |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Repo Structure** | Single repository for multiple projects | Separate repositories for each project |
| **Code Sharing** | Easy to share and reuse code | Requires versioning and package management |
| **Dependency Management** | Centralized (e.g., using Lerna, Nx, Turborepo) | Each repo manages dependencies separately |
| **CI/CD** | Unified pipeline for all services | Separate pipelines per service |
| **Scaling** | Works well for **small-to-medium** projects | Better for large teams working independently |

---

## **🔹 When to Use a Monorepo?**
✅ **Multiple related projects** that need shared dependencies.  
✅ **Code reuse** across different services or applications.  
✅ **Easier dependency management** within a single repository.  
✅ **Better CI/CD control** with a single pipeline.  

> Example: **Google, Facebook, and Microsoft** use monorepos to manage their large-scale projects.

## **🔹 Monorepo in Microservices with LoopBack 4**
If you're building a **microservices architecture** using **LoopBack 4**, a **monorepo** structure can help manage multiple services in one repository.

### **Example Folder Structure**
```
/loopback-monorepo
│── /services
│   ├── /book-service  (LoopBack 4 microservice)
│   ├── /author-service (LoopBack 4 microservice)
│   ├── /order-service  (LoopBack 4 microservice)
│── /packages
│   ├── /common-models (Shared models)
│   ├── /common-utils  (Shared utilities)
│── /api-gateway (API Gateway using Express.js)
│── package.json
│── tsconfig.json
│── lerna.json (if using Lerna)
│── nx.json (if using Nx)
```

## **🔹 Tools for Managing a Monorepo**
1️⃣ **Lerna** – Manages multiple JavaScript/TypeScript packages in a monorepo.  
2️⃣ **Nx** – Optimized for microservices and large-scale applications.  
3️⃣ **Turborepo** – Fast, modern build system for JavaScript monorepos.  
4️⃣ **Bazel** – Google's open-source build tool for large monorepos.  

---
## **🔹 Monorepo in LoopBack 4: How to Set Up?**
1️⃣ **Initialize the Monorepo**
```sh
mkdir loopback-monorepo && cd loopback-monorepo
npm init -y
```
2️⃣ **Add Lerna for Managing Microservices**
```sh
npx lerna init
```
3️⃣ **Create Microservices**
```sh
lerna create book-service packages --template=loopback4
lerna create author-service packages --template=loopback4
```
4️⃣ **Share Models Across Services**
```sh
lerna create common-models packages
```
5️⃣ **Run All Services Together**
```sh
lerna run start
```
---
## **🔹 When NOT to Use a Monorepo**
❌ If teams need **full autonomy** to deploy independently.  
❌ If services have **very different technology stacks**.  
❌ If the repository grows **too large** (e.g., 100+ services).
